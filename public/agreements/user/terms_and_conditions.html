<p>(c) You acknowledge and agree that if your Payment Instructions identify an account by name and account number, the relevant financial institution may execute those Payment Instructions by reference to the account number only, even if such account number does not correspond to the account name.&nbsp;&nbsp;You further acknowledge and agree that financial institutions holding the account may choose to not investigate discrepancies between account names and account numbers and that we have no responsibility to investigate discrepancies between account names and account numbers.</p>
<p>(d) You agree that we will not be liable in any way for any payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.</p>
<p>(e) We will use reasonable efforts to complete all your Payment Instructions properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>(f) It is the responsibility of the Sender and the Receiver to ensure the accuracy of any information that they enter into the Service (including but not limited to the Payment Instructions and name, address, telephone number and/or email address for the Receiver to whom you are attempting to send the Payment Instruction), and for informing us as soon as possible if they become aware that this information is inaccurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Sender nor Receiver may use a P.O. Box as a postal address.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make a reasonable effort to stop or recover a payment made to the wrong person or entity once informed, but we do not guarantee such stoppage or recovery and will bear no responsibility or liability for damages resulting from incorrect information entered by the Sender or Receiver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>14.&nbsp;Receiving Payments.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If another person wants to initiate a Payment Instruction (in response to a SMX Request or otherwise) using the Service to an Eligible Transaction Account you hold or, if you as a Requestor want to initiate a SMX Request, he, she or you can do that from an Eligible Transaction Account at a financial institution that participates in the SMX service or at the Site.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event that funds are transferred into your Eligible Transaction Account as a result of a Payment Instruction and it is determined that such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by the sender, because there were not sufficient funds in the sender's account, or for any other reason, then you hereby authorize us to withdraw from your Eligible Transaction Account an amount equal to the amount of funds improperly transferred to you.</p>
<p>If you as a Requestor initiate a SMX Request using the Service you acknowledge and agree that as disclosed on the Site, (a) the applicable service fee will be deducted from payments received by the you from a Sender(s), and (b) no service fee will be charged if you as the Requestor do not receive any payments from the individuals to whom the SMX Request is sent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further details about the foregoing can be found on the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that individuals to whom you send a SMX Request may not receive, or otherwise may reject or ignore, your SMX Request.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not guarantee that you will receive any payments from individuals by initiating a SMX Request.<br /><br />The Application is not intended for use by persons in any jurisdiction or country where such use would be contrary to local laws or regulations.

If permitted by law and enforcement, you may request payment of the Refund in another currency approved and made available by SMX from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>15.&nbsp;Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sender may cancel the initiation of a Payment Instruction or stop a Payment Instruction at any time until the processing of the Payment Instruction into the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account has begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to stop a Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on the manner in which the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account has begun processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request and to recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction, we will have no liability for failing to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also require you to present your stop payment request or request to recover funds in writing within fourteen (14) days after contacting us.&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge for each stop payment or fund recovery request will be the current charge for such stop payment or funds recovery service as set out in the applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments not claimed by a Receiver will be automatically cancelled ten (10) days after the processing of the payment begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Sender initiates a Payment Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that you as a Sender will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from a Receiver's decision to accept or not to accept a payment initiated or attempted through the Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16.&nbsp;Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately following your discovery of an unauthorized Payment Instruction, you shall communicate with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence such situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you tell us within two (2) Business Days after you discover your password or other means to access your account through which you access the Service has been lost or stolen, your liability is no more than $50.00 should someone access your account without your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use of your password or other means to access your account if you had told us, you could be liable for as much as $500.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your monthly financial institution statement contains Payment Instructions that you did not authorize, you must tell us at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was sent to you, you may lose any amount transferred without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) prevented you from telling us, we may in our sole discretion extend the period.<br /><br />You represent and warrant that all information entered into the request or form submitted through the application is true and complete, including information about you, your Payment Account and your Beneficiary. When processing a remittance payment, SMX may rely on the registration information and remittance information provided by you. You acknowledge that any errors in the information, including misidentification of the Beneficiary(s), incorrect names and account numbers (such as bank account number, IBAN or email associated with the account) or inconsistent data, spelling errors, are the responsibility of you. In this sense, we do not assume any responsibility or provide any kind of refund as a result of such events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>19.&nbsp;Failed Or Returned Payment Instructions.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any potential payment failure, lack of transfer of money is not our responsibility or legal competence. In this sense, we have no direct or consequential liability for any potential shortfall in purchases, availability of money on account or sales.</p>
