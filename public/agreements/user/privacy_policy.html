<li><strong>With Your Consent.</strong>&nbsp;We may share information with your consent.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.&nbsp;We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p><strong>5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>6. SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>SMX is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p><strong>7. DATA RETENTION</strong></p>
<p>As requested by the GDPR, We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><br /><strong>8. ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>As GDPR provides, you have the full right accessing to certain information associated with your Account sending as an email. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit SMX's ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit SMX's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to SMX or a third party.</p>
<p><strong>9. YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to&nbsp;<strong>access, correct, update, or request deletion</strong>&nbsp;of your personal information, you can do so at any time by emailing us.</li>
<li>In addition, you can&nbsp;<strong>object to the processing</strong>&nbsp;of your personal information, ask us to&nbsp;<strong>restrict the processing</strong>&nbsp;of your personal information, or&nbsp;<strong>request portability</strong>&nbsp;of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by emailing&nbsp;us.</li>
<li>You have the right to&nbsp;<strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong>&nbsp;we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you.&nbsp;To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us by emailing&nbsp;us.</li>
<li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can&nbsp;<strong>withdraw your consent</strong>&nbsp;at any time.&nbsp;Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>You have the&nbsp;<strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong>&nbsp;about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>10. YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
<p>You can use some of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us. If you wish to do so, simply follow the instructions found at the end of the email. Even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you for informational, transactional, account-related, or similar purposes.</p>
<p>Many browsers have an option for disabling cookies, which may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or enable selective use of cookies. Please note that, if you choose not to accept cookies, some features and the personalization of our Services may no longer work for you. You will continue to receive advertising material but it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>11. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>As GDPR requires, SMX does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and children under 13 are prohibited from using our Services. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, you can alert us at our official email address.</p>
<p><strong>12. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so please review it frequently. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our App. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our Services, by email, or other communication.</p>
<p><strong>13. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>SMX is a global business. We may transfer personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.</strong>&nbsp;For personal data we receive from the EEA and Switzerland, SMX has certified its compliance to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from such countries.
